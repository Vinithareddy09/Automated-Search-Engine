# Automated Search Engine 🔍🤖

An automated search engine interface built using Python and web scraping tools. This project takes a user's query, performs a web search, extracts relevant data, and presents summarized or structured results — simulating a basic search engine behavior.

## 🧾 Overview

- Accepts user queries via input  
- Scrapes search engine results programmatically  
- Extracts titles, links, and brief snippets  
- Can be extended for ranking, filtering, or AI summarization  
- Ideal for learning web scraping, automation, and information retrieval basics

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:
  - `requests` – to fetch search result pages  
  - `BeautifulSoup` – for parsing and extracting data from HTML  
  - `re` – for pattern matching and cleanup  
  - `time` / `random` – for delay management (anti-bot techniques)

## 🚀 Features

- Command-line interface to input a search query  
- Automated scraping and display of search results  
- Clean and readable output with titles and URLs  
- Simple structure, easy to extend with AI modules or UI
